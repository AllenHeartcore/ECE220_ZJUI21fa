	###### Functionality ######
	Compile by running:	make; make clean
	Execute by running:	./mp9 graph requests; make image
	The program outputs:	A .png file named "image.png"

	###### Function Documentation ######
	The functions operate as follows: 
	match_requests:	Search for possible source and destination points based on <requests "r1" and "r2">, 
			and schedule the shortest path between them. Return 1 if succeed, 0 otherwise.
